## Technical Writing Mentorship Program: Assignment 2

This repository `Getting Started with Glasp: A guide on how to use the Glasp highlighting tool ` is my submission for the second task of the technical writing mentorship program.
This task is to write an article covering everything about Glasp, which I tried to cover exhaustively in the ReadMe file.
I went to town on this piece to ensure anyone without prior knowledge of Glasp will in the few minutes of going through this repo understand everything they need to know to get started and navigate the app.
With careful attention to detail, this article is written for a novice and carefully reviewed to ensure it is free of grammatical or spelling errors.
To keep the readers glued, I avoided the use of repetitive and filler words which makes an article uninteresting.
It's almost impossible to go over every area of Glasp because of its many features and capabilities, so I attached extra resources on what is obtainable with the app.
This article is written using the Google style guide.
