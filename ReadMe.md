# Introduction

Reading online was less exciting for most people like myself because of the lack of ways to highlight and create notes easily while reading. That challenge no longer exists with the advent of highlighting apps. Glasp has taken highlighting articles to a new level by providing a platform that publicises your highlight and notes. It also connects you to people reading the same articles as you are and other benefits you will come to appreciate as you read on.

The world is better today because of the knowledge and ideas passed down from generation to generation. Glasp is facilitating the spread of knowledge by providing a platform that makes highlighting remarkable points in an article or video possible and accessible to all.
Glasp is solving the problem of isolated learning. Learning in isolation is a slower approach to gaining knowledge and developing intellectual depth. With democratised access to highlighted information, people with less intellectual prowess can access highlighted information and notes from people who are well-read.

# What is Glasp?

Glasp is an acronym that stands for _`Greatest Legacy Accumulated as Shared Proof`_. It is a social app that allows you to highlight important and salient points you come across while reading articles or watching videos on the web using its browser extension and makes it accessible to like-minded people on its social platform.

In spite of the fact that what we see is the same, we all see things differently, as explained by the saying `We all look but see differently.` When reading the same book, each of us may have different interpretations, conclusions, and takeaways depending on a variety of variables. Through access to other users' highlights and notes, Glasp has made it possible to see various viewpoints, ideas, and thoughts about an article or video.

## Reasons Why you need Glasp

- **As an avid reader and learner, leave your intellectual footprint in the sands of time**.

  According to Glasp, its mission is to democratize access to other people's learning and experience that they have collected throughout their lives as a utilitarian legacy. With Glasp you can make your knowledge, insights and experience about an article or video public so that people can access and appreciate them after you die.

- **keep track of articles you read and quickly refresh your knowledge of an article**.

  With Glasp it is easy to remember the articles you have read and highlights from those articles. This comes in handy when doing research and needing to read a lot of articles and pick out key points from them. This is useful for students, researchers and writers.

- **Join a community of like-minded readers and knowledge seekers**

  For each article read and highlighted on the platform. Glasp creates a community in which anyone who has read and highlighted an article can interact with others who have also read and highlighted the article. This interaction is in the form of writing comments and replying to comments.
