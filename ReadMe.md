# Introduction

The world is better today because of the knowledge and ideas passed down from generation to generation. Glasp is making it easy for knowledge to be passed down by providing a platform that makes highlighting remarkable points in an article or video possible and accessible to all.
Glasp is solving the problem of isolated learning. Learning in isolation is a much slower way of gathering knowledge and building intellectual depth, with democratised access to highlighted information, people who are less intellectual can access highlighted information and notes from people who are well-read.

# What is Glasp

Glasp is an app that allows you to highlight important and salient points you come across while reading articles or watching videos on the web through its browser extension and makes it accessible to like-minded people on its social platform.

“We all look but see differently” is a common saying that explains the fact that even while what we see is the same our thoughts and perspective about what we see differs. We can all read the same book and have different perspectives, thoughts and take-away from the book, which can depend on several factors. Glasp has made it possible to see different perspectives, thoughts and ideas about an article or video through access to highlights and notes of other people.

## Reasons Why you need Glasp

- **As an avid reader and learner, leave your intellectual footprint in the sands of time**.

- **keep track of articles you read and easily refresh your knowledge of an article**.
